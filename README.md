# Assignment Instructions
The motivation of collaborative filtering comes from the idea that you'll probably like things that people with similar viewing habits also like.

For this activity, in 500-750 words, answer the following:

1. Formulate a prediction question that you want to answer by applying a collaborative filtering recommender algorithm. Examples: How to determine which users or movies are similar to one another; how to determine the rating that a user would give to a movie based on the ratings of similar users; how to measure the accuracy of the ratings.
2. Search and locate a dataset that is relevant to the question(s) you created in the previous step. You may search repositories such as Data.gov, UCI Machine Learning, Kaggle, or Scikit-Learn.
3. Import the necessary libraries in Python for building a recommender system.
4. Load the dataset into a data frame and preprocess it as needed.
5. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
6. Fit a recommender system model on the training data.
7. Make some predictions and use MAE and RMSE to measure/estimate the accuracy of your predictions. Report and interpret the results.
8. Use the GridSearchCV class to fine-tune the algorithm parameters. Report the best parameter for any accuracy measure. Explain.
